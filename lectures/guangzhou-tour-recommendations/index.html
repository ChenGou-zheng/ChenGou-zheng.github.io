This personal travel guide is a summary of a sweet holiday I spent with my girlfriend 🌸 romantically strolling through the vibrant city of Guangzhou.
In short, you’ll get a real taste of traditional Guangzhou flavor 🍜 — a unique blend of history, culture, and modern life. The itinerary includes a series of well-connected spots that can be flexibly arranged into time blocks.
For example, a typical block could span from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and most of these suggested routes naturally include a famous local restaurant 🍲 — because in Guangzhou, food is basically a core API function 😉.
It&rsquo;s time consuming to type them into GoogleMap, so please finish the final step yourself !
Inside one block, everysite is near to each other within a 10mins walk.
