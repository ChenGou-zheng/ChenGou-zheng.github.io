# Introduction
- This personal travel guide is a summary of a sweet holiday I spent with my girlfriend 🌸 romantically strolling through the vibrant city of Guangzhou.
- In short, you’ll get a real taste of traditional Guangzhou flavor 🍜 — a unique blend of history, culture, and modern life. The itinerary includes a series of well-connected spots that can be flexibly arranged into time blocks.
- For example, a typical block could span from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and most of these suggested routes naturally include a famous local restaurant 🍲 — because in Guangzhou, food is basically a core API function 😉.
- It's time consuming to type them into GoogleMap, so please finish the final step yourself !
- Inside one block, everysite is near to each other within a 10mins walk.

#### Notes:
1. Notes : please tour around the island of Museum of Art, it's the best community to live in Guangzhou, and maybe you could see some roadbikes, which is a good training spot. The architectures around the Dongshanhu Park are a league of its own, with its famous red walls and green tiles. That's the traditional color in Cantonese houses.
2. Restaurant : try **chicken, fish** and **dessert**, or follow the common choice in MEITUAN. There are some set meals.
